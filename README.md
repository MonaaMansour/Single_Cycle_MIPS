# Single_Cycle_MIPS
#the design of Single Cycle MIPS Processor using verilog HDL.

#The processor was designed using MIPS ISA and It's a 32-bit instruction format (RISC).

#The testing of the processor was done using modelsim for two programs ( GCD program and Factorial Number program). These two programs were written in machine code language and loaded into the Instruction Memory.
